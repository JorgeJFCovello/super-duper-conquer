# super-duper-conquer

# Explanation

- Players throw a dice when it is required
- Playares can join in battle for a handicap match or to create one 🤯
- It works with actually countries
- Each players starts with some standard resources (1 heavy bomb, 4 bombarders, 20 units, 10 plans and 4 ships)
- Every player can create an alliance since both parts agrees but it could end in a betray any moment❗❗❗
- If one region is attacked with heavy bombs it can't be used in the next 4 turns (and if you strike with 2 heavy bombs more it is going to be a non-habitable zone) 💣

# Combats

# advantage and disadvantage

- Heavy bomb > all
- Bombarders > ships (1-2)
- Bombarders > units (1-4)
- planes > bombarders (1-2)
- ships > planes (1-3)
- ships > units (1-2)

Remember that without units you can't control a region. Also your enemies can create disturbs if you are lack of them

# Trades
When you get an especific number of units, you can make a trade

- 4 units --> bombarder
- 4 units --> 2 plains
- 5 units --> a ship
- 3 bombarders + 10 units + 2 plains + 1 ship --> heavy bomb

# super-duper-conquer

# Explanation

- Players throw a dice when it is required
- Playares can join in battle for a handicap match or to create one ü§Ø
- It works with actually countries
- Each players starts with some standard resources (1 heavy bomb, 4 bombarders, 20 units, 10 plans and 4 ships)
- Every player can create an alliance since both parts agrees but it could end in a betray any moment‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
- If one region is attacked with heavy bombs it can't be used in the next 4 turns (and if you strike with 2 heavy bombs more it is going to be a non-habitable zone) üí£
- If a region its surrounded for bombs attacks all units inside are considerer dead. The closest player will be owner of the region when this be reopened. In case of tie, only the player with the largest army will get the region. A player can ask for a warzone in case the difference of thoses armies are not too much.

# Combats

# Advantage and disadvantage

- Heavy bomb > all
- Bombarders > ships (1-2)
- Bombarders > units (1-4)
- planes > bombarders (1-2)
- ships > planes (1-3)
- ships > units (1-2)

Remember that without units you can't control a region. Also your enemies can create disturbs if you are lack of them.

# Trades
When you get an especific number of units, you can make a trade

- 4 units ‚û°Ô∏è 1 bombarder.
- 4 units ‚û°Ô∏è 2 plains.
- 5 units ‚û°Ô∏è 1 ship.
- 3 bombarders + 10 units + 2 plains + 1 ship ‚û°Ô∏è 1 heavy bomb.

# Dynamics

1. Player select the region to attack.
2. Difference between attacked force and defender force is the number of dice trys (Remebember all rounded it's in defenders favour).
3. Roll dices.
4. Comparer the greatest attackers dice with the greatest defenders dice and the smallest with the smallest... you got this.
5. The lose roll, loses units, then ships, then planes, and finally bombarders.
6. The first one on complete all this conditions it is the winner:
    - 1 bombarder for each 5 units.
    - 1 ship for each 3 units.
    - 1 plane for each unit.
    
# End of round

When it finish all users gets units as much as regions they have plus 2 units for region capture.
If you get a region for more than 4 turns you get 2 extra units as well.

# Warzones
When its a war zone, aliances no exist. It's a classic free for all. A war zone takes all areas afected for bombs and aliances don't exist in the 3 nearest regions.
